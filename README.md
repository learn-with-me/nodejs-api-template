# Nodejs Template

The template comes with a few preset features that I may be using in future projects

## Features

1. Commit hooks and automation via [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky)
2. Code formatter via [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
3. Lint using [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)
4. GitHub workflow configured to check pull requests
