# Documentation

[jsDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc) is a pretty solid tool to document your API if you're building a library.

Yet to be added using either [docdash](https://github.com/clenemt/docdash) template or [better-docs](https://github.com/SoftwareBrothers/better-docs) template.

Finally we'll [integrate](https://github.com/andstor/jsdoc-action) it with GitHub action, to push the changes out automatically.
